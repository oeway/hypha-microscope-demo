### Tutorial: Building a Distributed Microscope Control Application with Hypha

This tutorial explains how to create a distributed application for controlling a microscope and snapping images using Hypha. It consists of two components: **Microscope Control** and a **User Interface**.

### Components Overview

#### 1. Microscope Control (`microscope.py`)

The microscope control component handles operations for moving the microscope stage and capturing images.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Move Stage**: Moves the microscope stage to specified X and Y offsets.
  - **Snap Image**: Simulates capturing an image, returning either a shared memory object (`SharedImage`) or a numpy array.

- **Implementation Highlights**:
  - **SharedImage**:
    - A custom class to transfer large image data efficiently via shared memory.
    - Includes methods to create, encode, decode, and restore images from shared memory.
  - **Schema Functions**:
    - `move_stage`: Moves the microscope stage based on user input.
    - `snap_image`: Captures a simulated image and optionally returns it via shared memory.
  - **Hypha Server Integration**:
    - Registers schema functions with the Hypha server, enabling access via the Hypha RPC framework.

#### 2. User Interface (`ui.py`)

The user interface allows users to interact with the microscope system, move the stage, and snap images.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Move Stage UI**: Provides input fields to move the stage to specified X and Y positions.
  - **Snap Image UI**: Captures and displays images in real-time, with customizable exposure times.

- **Implementation Highlights**:
  - **Built with PyQt5**:
    - Provides a responsive and user-friendly interface.
    - Displays captured images using a `QLabel`.
  - **Integration with Microscope Control**:
    - Connects to the Hypha server to invoke `move_stage` and `snap_image` functions.
  - **Timer-Based Image Updates**:
    - Uses a `QTimer` to update snapped images at regular intervals.

### Workflow Overview
Before start, make sure you have installed the required packages:
```bash
conda install pyqt
pip install hypha-rpc hypha pydantic
```

1. **Set Up the Hypha Server**:
   Start the Hypha server on your machine:
   ```bash
   python3 -m hypha.server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9527
   ```

2. **Deploy Microscope Control**:
   - Run `microscope.py` to register the microscope control service.
   - The service enables controlling the microscope stage and capturing images.

3. **Launch the User Interface**:
   - Run `ui.py` to open the GUI.
   - The GUI connects to the microscope control service, allowing users to:
     - Move the microscope stage.
     - Snap images and view them in real-time.

### Interaction Between Components

1. The **Hypha Server** serves as the communication hub between the microscope control component and the UI.
2. The **Microscope Control Service** handles backend operations for stage movement and image capture.
3. The **User Interface** sends commands to the microscope service and displays the results (e.g., snapped images).

---

### How It Works Together

1. **Starting the Server**:
   The Hypha server is started to enable communication between components.

2. **Microscope Control Service**:
   - Registers two schema functions:
     - `move_stage`: Moves the microscope stage based on user input.
     - `snap_image`: Captures a simulated image, optionally using shared memory.

3. **User Interface**:
   - Allows users to interact with the microscope control service via input fields and buttons.
   - Captured images are displayed in real-time in the UI.

### Future Extensions

- Add more microscope operations, such as focusing or changing magnification.
- Integrate real microscope hardware into the system.
- Extend the UI to include advanced visualization and analysis tools.

This streamlined setup demonstrates the power of Hypha in building distributed, modular scientific applications with efficient data handling.
